# Generalized Fast Krasnoselskii-Mann Method with Preconditioners: Example code

This repository contains the experimental source code to reproduce the numerical experiments in:

* A. Akerman, E. Chenchene, P. Giselsson, E. Naldi. Characterization of Nonexpansive Forward-Backward-type Algorithms with Minimal Memory Requirements. 2025. [ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.yyyyy)

To reproduce the results of the numerical experiments run:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
